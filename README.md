# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a grid-based game inspired by Tic-Tac-Toe, where a human player competes against the computer. The objective is to align a specific number of symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win. The game supports customizable board sizes and win conditions, making it more challenging than the classic Tic-Tac-Toe. The computer uses a basic AI to determine its moves, exploring possible outcomes up to a specified depth.
